					<p>
						I understand that trying to learn machine learning can be difficult. I, also, am still trying to 
						learn it. There are many times I want to give up. Below contains a table of
						some of my reasons that I tell myself that machine learning is not right for me.
					</p>
					
					<!-- the table has a list of doubts I go through when learning ML -->
					<table id="a-table">
						<caption>Negative self-beliefs</caption>

								<th>Explanation</th>

								<td>
									<p>I am not smart enough to learn machine learning.</p>
								</td>

								<td>
									<p>
										Many times, I look at the books and web articles that cover machine learning 
										and feel overwhelmed. I get very intimidated by the various kinds of concepts and 
										ideas that need to be learned. I wonder what is wrong with my brain and why can I not 
										understand the concepts. 
									</p>
								</td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
								<td>
									<p>I do not have enough money to learn machine learning.</p>
								</td>

								<td>
									<p>
										I see so many websites offering training or products that promises to
										help me learn machine learning for a cost that is way more than I can afford. 
										It often feels that anything I can use to help myself is outside of my price range.
										It feels discouraging.
									</p>
								</td>
							</tr>
					
							<tr>
								<td>
									<p>I do not have enough time to learn machine learning.</p>
								</td>
								<td>
									<p>
										There are a lot of people that are suggesting a lot of things for me to learn.
										It often feels that I could not possibly learn all these things and that it would take
										me many lifetimes to comprehend machine learning. It is easy for me to see all that I
										have to learn and feel overwhelmed. I wonder why should I even start when I am not
										going to get much done anyway.

				<section id="my-advice">
					<h3 class="section-title">My advice for the journey ahead</h3>
					<p>
						I often must remind myself not to let my self-limiting beliefs get the best of me. 
						The truth is that the web offers much relief. There are many people who are working hard 
						to make machine learning more accessible and affordable for people to learn and to use. 
						It is easy to get caught up in what is too difficult to do in the present moment.  
					</p>
				
					<p>
						Please do not allow yourself to get burnt out over worries and fears. Search the web, and 
						you will find someone in a situation that can relate and help, or you will find an article 
						or a book that you can use to keep going. I often listen to motivational music, look at 
						motivational clips at YouTube, and do a lot of walking. It is important to stay balanced 
						and remain patient.  
					</p>
					
					<p>
						There is no need to rush nor compare yourself to others. Be patient. Just keep going. 
						Set realistic expectations and goals that are your own. Do not let obstacles or people tell you what is 
						right for you. Use your own judgement. You will get through it. Just keep trying and searching 
						for a way, and you will find one that will help you get better at machine learning.
