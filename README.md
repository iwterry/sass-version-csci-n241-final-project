# About

This repository is for modifying my CSCI N241 final project, which was 
done during the 2017 Spring Semester @ Indiana University - Purdue 
University Indianapolis. My goal is to play around with SASS and use a 
little CSS flexbox for website navigation bar. I think I did a decent 
job, but I was in rush and decided not to spend too much time on 
changing this project.
