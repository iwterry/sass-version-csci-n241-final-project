					<h3>Mission</h3>
					<p>
						The mission of this website is to help get more people interested in machine learning and to
						be a resource for ways to learn more about (and do more with) machine learning. 
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<!-- section for vision statement -->
				<section id="site-vision">
					<h3>Vision</h3>
					<p>
						The vision of this website is for it to be a light that can make the path towards learning and using 
						machine learning easier. Regardless of their educational background, gender, income, etc., people
						should have more access to an education for machine learning. Machine learning must be more inclusive.
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<!-- section for goals -->
				<section id="site-goals">
					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<p>
						I have three major goals for this website:
					</p>
					<ul id="unordered-list">
						<li>Provide resources to explain what machine learning is and how it is being used in the world</li>
						<li>Provide resources for practicing and knowing some fundamentals of machine learning</li>
						<li>Provide some motivation for learning machine learning when the journey gets hard</li> 
					</ul>
