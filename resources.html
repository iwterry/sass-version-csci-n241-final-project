					<h3>What are some software that are used for machine learning?</h3>
					<p>
						<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and 
						<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> are probably the two most
						popular free choices that are used for machine learning. A great place to learn how to 
						use these two pieces of software is at <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">
						DataCamp</a>. DataCamp has a monthly fee of &#36;29 (US), plus it provides a lot 
						of topics that are important when using and learning about machine learning. Another option
						is to search <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> or 
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> for Python or R materials.
						Udemy often has discounts for courses that are &#36;10 (US), but YouTube provides a great free
						option. You can also try searching your favorite search engine for materials on Python or R. 
						(Note: Other popular software choices include Microsoft Excel and 
						<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/">MATLAB</a>.)
